- [AutoSnapper](https://github.com/batmad/autoit-auto-snapper) - A collection of AutoIt scripts designed to automate tasks like logging in, navigating to specific pages, taking screenshots, managing configurations, and sending images through WhatsApp Desktop.
- [EmailScheduler](https://github.com/batmad/email-scheduler) - A Node.js application to automate email scheduling and sending using node-cron and nodemailer. This project allows you to schedule email delivery at specific times and automate the process using SMTP services such as Gmail.
